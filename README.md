This program was a college project to demonstrate the usage of Data Sctructures and Fundamental Algorithms.\
I used file reading and writing, Doubly-Linked List Structure and Bubble Sort algorithm.\
It simulates a beer-keg's inventory to keep record of the current beer in a bar. I came with the idea of this program 
because I, at that time, was working at a craft beer bar and realised that they did not have a way to keep track of the 
kegs they had connected to the tap but for a written paper so I figured I could optimize the process.\
